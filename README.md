## Versioning
This repository will follow semantic versioning. This means as we continue with lectures, I will update the repository with either *minor* or *micro* tag updates. Each version will update this read me about the changes we accomplished in that lecture.

## Versions
The following are the versioning changelogs.

## Version 0.1.0
We realized we had duplicate code. Because of so, we decided to *abstract* out those features and put them into a parent class named `Bottle`, and *extend* `Bottle` into our 3 bottle-typed classes.

## Version 0.0.2
This version simply adds the `toString` methods which were required.

## Version 0.0.1
Adds base objects of `SodaBottle`, `BeerBottle`, `WaterBottle` with no inheritance. Also provides empty objects of `Soda`, `Beer`, and `Water` for *has-a* relationships.

## Version 0.0.0
Initial - no code.
